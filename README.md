Chinese Characters Input System
It is well known that the Chinese characters are easier to memorize as a set of simpler components. Why not try not only to memorize but to enter them as a set of components? I developed a simple system of entering characters "by component" to search them in the dictionary. Not phonetic, and no need to use keyboard for charactrs input. It's very usefull for input those characters, the pronunciation of which is unknown or forgotten.

Moreover, it was found that more than 80% of used in my system characters (more than 4,300 pieces) you can enter with two clicks of the mouse or two touches of the finger on the touch screen. The remaining 20 % require three clicks or touches. It's amazing, and it would not be excusable not to use this opportunity...

Based on this input system I have done a few simple tools for memorizing characters themselves, for writing and for finding characters in the dictionary. You can see short description of this input system at (http://poutko.ru/Compositor/EnglishDescription.html) or download this tools from (http://poutko.ru/China/Writer_III.zip and http://poutko.ru/China/Tutor_III.zip - JRE requared) or try some of its features (writing tools and dictionary) on-line (http://poutko.ru/Compositor/english.html).

The programs written in Java. I'm interested in porting this system on android.
